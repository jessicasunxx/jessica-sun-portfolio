            A small soldered sculpture on a protoboard where two looping brass
            rods rise from a 12-pin header, hinting at signal paths and stories
            I will explore throughout this class.

              <li>Cleaned excess flux, checked each joint for strength, and photographed the sculpture against a simple background to highlight its silhouette.</li>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This project turned soldering from a purely functional skill into a
            way of sketching in three dimensions. Limiting myself to a single
            brass rod and a tiny protoboard made every bend and every joint
            feel important, because a small change could shift the balance or
            break the clean line of the loops.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned how much control it takes to place heat and solder
            exactly where I want it without re-melting previous joints, and how
            tools like helping hands quietly shape what forms are even possible.
            The two loops feel like parallel signal paths or ideas that start
            from the same point and diverge, which is how I think about my work
            in this class: branching experiments grounded in the same hardware
            skills. In future pieces, I want to build on this by layering more
            complex forms and eventually embedding actual electronics into the
            structures.
