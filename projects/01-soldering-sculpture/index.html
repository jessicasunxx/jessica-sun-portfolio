          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This project turned soldering from a purely functional skill into a
            way of drawing in three dimensions. Working at this small scale made
            every bend and joint feel consequential, because a millimeter shift
            could change the center of gravity or the silhouette completely.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned how much control is needed to place heat and solder
            precisely without melting previous connections, and how tools like
            helping hands become part of the design process rather than just
            supports. If I iterate on this idea, I would like to push the
            structure taller and more precarious while still keeping it
            self-supporting, and experiment with introducing light or motion
            into the form.
